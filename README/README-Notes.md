# Portfolio
This is a class a portfolio that will show case my work through out the course. Right now since the course just started we don't have anything to put in it yet but it will show case the work that I am capable of.

I use CSS flex and grid styles to make the elements flexible with the window size. I used Psudeo element too.

The App work when you hover over the the header and footer elements they should higlight. The links are dissablesed w/ # except for the Github and Linkdin so they should take you to my actual linkdin and git acount. the Image Icons also are links but they are dissabled with #'s as due just starting the course I don't have anything to attach yet. The website adapts to the window size of the computer monitor as well.
